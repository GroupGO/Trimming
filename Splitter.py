A collection of functions designed to split a merged, paired-end FASTQ file into its forward and
reverse components.

In order to provide readable and understandable code, the right indentation margin has been
increased from 79 to 99 characters, which remains in line with Python-Style-Recommendation (
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) .This allows for longer, more descriptive variable
and function names, as well as more extensive doc-strings.
